Th e Revisited: Producer/Consumer Interaction with a Bounded Buffer
In this exercise you will re-implement your sequential C program from Homework 1 as a multithreaded
program using the ST threading package.
The goal of this exercise is decompose the processing of Homework 1 into a data-flo w and to
have a thread responsible for the processing of each stage in the pipeline. As the term is used here, a
pipeline refers to an organization of threads wherein each thread inputs data from a single source (either a
device or another thread) and outputs data to a single sink (which is again either a device or another
thread). In such a pipeline, a pair of adjacent threads acts as a simple producer/consumer system wherein
one thread processes data and the n processed data for the next thread t o
In more detail, in a data-flow pipeline each pair of communicating threads is constructed as a producer/
consumer system with a bounded buffer. The ith thread in the pipeline, Ti, reads (inputs) data that is
generated by thread Ti
