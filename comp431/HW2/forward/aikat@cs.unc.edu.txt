Test 1 - This is just a normal and correct message.
This should work fine, with a '250 OK' after the MAIL FROM
and RCPT TO commands, a "354 Blah' after the DATA command,
a '250 OK' after the end of data at which point, the message is
written to file ./forward/aikat@cs.unc.edu
Test #1 is 10 points - 4 for the 4 server responses, 6 for write to file
Tests #2 to #5 carry 6 points each.
Tests #6 to #14 carry 3 points each.
Tests #15 to #17 carry 4 points each.
EOF (end-of-file) handling is 2 points
On some tests, where a command was ill-formed you could have waited for the
correct well-formed expected next command, or decided to throw out that
message altogether. Either is correct.

Test 2 - This message has two receivers.
So, there should be two files in the forward directory
with this same message. And this should be appended to end of the file
aikat@cs.unc.edu created for test 1.

Program should generate a 503 error.

Test 15 - This message does not have a bad sequence of commands
- the RCPT TO: command after the well-formed DATA command should be treated
as part of the message body.
From: jeffay@cs.unc.edu
To: aikat@cs.unc.edu
Test 16 - This message has two senders which is not valid.
Once you see a valid MAIL FROM: command, you should wait for a valid RCPT TO:
command.
