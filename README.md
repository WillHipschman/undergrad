The undegrad repository is used to store some of the programming projects I built during my undergrad at UNC (2008-2012)

Contents:
comp431:	Contains several java assignments. The ultimate assignment is an email client.
comp530:	Contains several C assignments. The ultimate assignment is a client/server shell implementation.
comp530Lab:	Contains several C assignments. The purpose was to teach students the basics of programming in C.
